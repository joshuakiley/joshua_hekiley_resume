## Summary

Since 2018 I’ve been deep diving into IT operations, finding fascination in improving system efficiency and security, especially through automation (Python and Bash are my go-to tools, alongside PowerShell and Power Automate, and I'm exploring Firebase Studio). I’ve led projects unifying MDM systems, rolling out passkeys, and managing identity platforms like Entra ID and Google Workspace. As a teacher turned IT Engineer, I bring a passion for technology and clear communication to solving challenging IT problems and contributing technical expertise to innovative teams.
